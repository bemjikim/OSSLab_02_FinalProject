### *What does this project do?*

> ##### This is a web project to give users info about the restaurants. It includes Menu, restaurant's number, delivery fee, opening time, pictures, and so on. You can choose the menu you want. You just see that information and you just order it! Furthermore, there are buttons called 'bookmark' for the add or delete. You can make your favorite menu list!

### *Why is this project useful?*

> ##### Nowadays, we often take delivery of food using apps. But there are so many restaurants that we can’t choose what we eat. To solve this problem, This project recommends the restaurant in the top 5 in HGU for students (especially first-year students who don’t know what is the famous restaurant). As a result, It will be helpful to use when they eat the delivery food.

### *Contribution*
#### 
I contribute to this project which was a simple web to show restaurant info. I divided three screens: main, food, and bookmark. The main screen has ten buttons which have bookmarks and other foods. These buttons link other HTML files. On the food screen, it shows the info of the restaurant and has a button that I used javascript to put the info on the local storage. On the bookmark screen, it shows the information we added. This information remains until you delete it. I made the delete button that eliminates all of the data. Also, I made the button that backs to the top. If you click that button, it scrolled back to the top.
